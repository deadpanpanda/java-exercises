The Australian Government will introduce a new personal income tax for 2023-2024. The personal income tax is calculated based on filing status and taxable income. There are four filing statuses: single filers, married filing jointly, married filing separately, and head of household. The tax rates vary every year. The following table shows the rates. If you are, say, single with a taxable income of $10,000, the first $8,350 is taxed at 10% and the other $1,650 is taxed at 15%. So, your tax is $1,082.5.

You need to write a program to compute the personal income tax. Your program should prompt the user to enter the filing status and taxable income and compute the tax. Enter 0 for single filers, 1 for married filing jointly, 2 for married filing separately, and 3 for head of household. 


Here are sample runs of the program:

Sample 1:

Enter the filing status: 0

Enter the taxable income: 100000

Tax is 21720.0


Sample 2:

Enter the filing status: 1

Enter the taxable income: 300339

Tax is 76932.87


Sample 3:

Enter the filing status: 2

Enter the taxable income: 123500

Tax is 29665.5


Sample 4:

Enter the filing status: 3

Enter the taxable income: 4545402

Tax is 1565250.7
